## Fudandori Apps: Privacy policy

All my Android apps are open source developed by Fermín Híjar Esplá. The source code is available on GitHub under the GNU General Public license (GPL); the apps are also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed my apps to collect any personally identifiable information. All internal data used by the apps is stored on your device and anonymously on the firebase database attached to a unique random ID with no connection to personal data or any kind of Device ID that could relate said information to you or your phone/device.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Fermín Híjar.
